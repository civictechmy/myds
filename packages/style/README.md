## 🚨 Migration Notice

This npm package (`@civictechmy/myds-style`) has been **deprecated** in favor of a modern, registry-based distribution via shadcn CLI.

### Why the change?

- ✅ **No npm dependencies** - Full ownership of your styles
- ✅ **Tailwind v4 native** - CSS-based configuration
- ✅ **Better customization** - Modify styles directly in your codebase
- ✅ **Dark mode support** - Built-in light/dark theme system
- ✅ **Granular control** - Install only what you need

### Migrate to MYDS v2

Instead of installing this package:

```bash
# ❌ Old way (deprecated)
npm install @civictechmy/myds-style
```

Use the new registry-based installation:

```bash
# ✅ New way (recommended)
npx shadcn@latest add myds-init --registry=https://civictechmy.github.io/myds/registry/style
```

For full migration instructions, see the [main README](../../README.md#migration-from-v1-npm).
